## Project Overview

1. **Objective**  
   - Demonstrate the benefits and limitations of traditional portfolio optimization (e.g., Markowitz model) versus a Transformer‐based approach.  
   - Specifically, explore **Performer**, a linear‐time Transformer variant, for portfolio weight prediction under various market conditions.

2. **Key Components**  
   - **Data Processing:** Acquire and clean historical financial data.  
   - **Modeling:** Train traditional optimization models (mean‐variance, etc.) and a Performer model for comparison.  
   - **Evaluation:** Compare performance metrics such as returns, risk, and Sharpe ratios.
